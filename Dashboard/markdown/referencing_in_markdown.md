Reference-style Links:
----------------------

> Reference-style links are a special kind of link that make URLs easier to display and read in Markdown. Reference-style links are constructed in two parts: the part you keep inline with your text and the part you store somewhere else in the file to keep the text easy to read.
> 
> Formatting the First Part of the Link
> The first part of a reference-style link is formatted with two sets of brackets. The first set of brackets surrounds the text that should appear linked. The second set of brackets displays a label used to point to the link youâ€™re storing elsewhere in your document.
> 
> Although not required, you can include a space between the first and second set of brackets. The label in the second set of brackets is not case sensitive and can include letters, numbers, spaces, or punctuation.
> 
> This means the following example formats are roughly equivalent for the first part of the link:

[hobbit-hole][1]
[hobbit-hole] [1]

[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle


Images:
-------

> To add an image, add an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in brackets, 
> and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses. You can optionally add a title in quotation marks after the path or URL.
